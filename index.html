        <p>This is the book analysis place, Keep the window open and read as much as you want. Ignore the site name, it was a mismatch for the budget(low), I will continue to add other books and analysis on the books on this site. Ads will be on the sides, also i will be adding analysis, to make it more original, onto the books for those who want to see it. Books are public domain so dont worry. It is mainly philosophy that is starred but depending on viewer feedback we can switch it to other things too.
